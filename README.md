# yo, I'm JJ 🧠  

engineer | student | web dev | **caffeine processor**  

I build things for the web because I can’t stand when stuff looks bad or runs slow.  
Always learning, always tweaking code until it stops yelling at me.

### ⚙️ what I use
**frontend:** React, Next.js, TS  
**backend:** Node, Express, Python  
**db:** Postgres, MongoDB  
**tools:** Docker, Git, Linux, VS Code  

### 🚧 current grind
- leveling up my full-stack game  
- designing cleaner architectures
- finding new music to code to

### 🕹️ when I'm not coding
cooking up side projects or breaking your ankles in padel
